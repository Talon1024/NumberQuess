Qt Number Guessing Game
=======================

This is my first Qt project. I made it with Qt Creator under a Kubuntu 16.04 virtual machine.

This kind of thing is just a starter project I like to do for each programming language I want to learn.

How to play
-----------

Enter your guess in the text box, and press Submit.

The game will end if you guess correctly, or you fail to guess the number before you run out of guesses. The text box and Submit buttons will then be disabled until you start a new game.

Press reset to start a new game.

You may only enter numbers in the text box. If you enter anything else other than a number and try to submit it, you'll get a warning, and your input won't be counted as a guess.
